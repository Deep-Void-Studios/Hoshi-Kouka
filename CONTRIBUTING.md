## Starting Out 

The first thing you should probably do is meet with the rest of the community. There are many people in the server,
both players and developers. We have a Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/ZCa3bqYvrN) and a Guilded server
[here](guilded.gg/hoshi-kouka), both having linked channels, though Guilded has more content, as it has many more
features, it's just less popular.

From there, you can meet with other contributors to find out what would be a good idea to work on.

## Setting Everything Up

We mainly use these programs for development:
- [Roblox Studio](create.roblox.com)
- [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Rojo ([VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evaera.vscode-rojo) or [command line](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel))
- Selene ([VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Kampfkarren.selene-vscode) or [command line](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/selene))
- Stylua ([VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua) or [command line](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua))
- Remodel ([Command line](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/remodel) only)

You can use whatever you want as long as it works, but it is highly recommended that you use these along with whatever else you like to use.

## Making Contributions

You can see anything that currently needs work in the Issues tab on the repository. To start editing, create a fork of Hoshi Kouka's current development branch (named after the current update) and try to name your fork appropriately. The name should describe whatever you are creating.
