# Hoshi-Kouka
Welcome to the Hoshi Kouka repository.
Hoshi Kouka is an open source sandbox survival game of a similar genre to Minecraft, though an entirely different style and not voxel-based. It is primarily worked on and managed by AimiIsFat but anyone is welcome to help the game's development. It is built on Roblox and the Luau language.
You can join the server on Guilded at guilded.gg/Hoshi-Kouka to meet with more of the community and find what needs work at the moment.

## Next Update: Pre-Alpha v2.1 - The Building Update

### [In Progress] Build or Destroy Anything
Part 1 of this feature is currently in progress in the current update, so the pictures below may not be final. Part 2 will include building structures like houses and fences.  
Note: All images below are from Pre-Alpha v2.1 Snapshot 1 but the version text wasn't updated immediately, so some are incorrectly marked as Pre-Alpha v2.0.

### [Planned] Many Different Paths To Take
There will be many different ways to play the game. You could be a farmer, a warrior, a miner, a wizard, or even just a simple traveler. As such, a leveling system is planned where you level up skills instead of a singular main level. You will also be able to create multiple characters so you don't have to make a new account to try a different path. There are also no classes, so you can max out every skill in theory, but it'll take a long time.

### [Planned] In-depth Character Creation
An in-depth character creation system is planned for later, with custom character models and many different customization options.

### [Planned] Advanced Combat System
A combat system, inspired by the combat system of Breath of the Wild, featuring many different types of combat and weapons to fit different playstyles is planned for later.
