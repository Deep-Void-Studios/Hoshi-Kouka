# Hoshi Kouka
Welcome to the Hoshi Kouka repository.
Hoshi Kouka is an open source sandbox survival game of a similar genre to Minecraft, though an entirely different style and not voxel-based. It is primarily worked on and managed by AimiIsFat but anyone is welcome to help the game's development. It is built on Roblox and the Luau language.
You can join the server on [Guilded](guilded.gg/hoshi-kouka) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/ZCa3bqYvrN) to meet with more of the community and find what needs work at the moment.
